## Idea of this project

Provide a bunch of most needed high level javascript utility functions, which will work in every browser and in nodejs.

## Features

- focused on speed
- high level api with lots of sugar
- no native prototype extensions, no global namespace polution
- use of ecma5 features if available and be ecma5 compatible if possible 
- well tested
- community driven
- intelligent build tool (include only what you need)
- don't reinvent the wheel, if there are a libs we could use - do it
- every function is as standalone as possible, to reduce dependencies (only if code overhead is minimal)
- no performance overhead for the server because of client support
